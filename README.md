# ⚡ US Monthly Electricity Production Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting monthly US electricity production using time series techniques. 📈🔌

🔑 **Key Components:**

1️⃣ **Data Preparation and Visualization:** 📊
We load and visualize the monthly US electricity production data from 1973 to 2005, applying logarithmic transformation and centering.

2️⃣ **Preliminary Analysis:** 🔍
We examine the components of the time series, including trend and seasonality, and analyze autocorrelation functions.

3️⃣ **Model Specification: 🧮**
We explore various ARIMA models, adjusting parameters for autoregression (p), differentiation (d), and moving average (q).

4️⃣ **Model Comparison:** 🏆
We compare different ARIMA models using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, AIC, and normality tests on residuals.

5️⃣ **Forecasting:** 🔮
We use the best-performing models to forecast future electricity production and evaluate their predictive accuracy.
